11,numeral classifier system,A numeral classifier system is a system of nomifiers which occurs on numerals and possibly on other adnominal modifiers but not on predicates.,"Gil (2005): ""in many ... languages, nouns in construction with numerals may occur with an additional grammatical element even when such nouns are of high countability... Such elements are typically referred to as sortal numeral classifiers. This term makes reference to one of the most salient functions of such forms, which is to divide the inventory of count nouns into semantic classes, each of which is associated with a different classifier.""",,,,,,,

32,indefinite article,An indefinite article is an article that very frequently accompanies indefinite nouns and that never accompanies definite nouns.,,"(From my Github comment: 
The problem here may be with deciding whether nominals ""commonly"" have an indefinite article in this language. If ""there are examples of indefinite nominals without an article"", this does not mean that there can be no indefinite article – unless one is as strict as the wiki comments say ("" In this question we need explicit support that indefinite NPs cannot occur without an indefinite/non-specific article."" – but this is too strict. I think there are very few if any languages where indefinite articles MUST occur on ALL indefinite nominals. I think it's more reasonable to define ""commonly have an indefinite article"" as ""clearly more often than one would use the numeral 'one' in a language like English that distinguished between 'one' and indefinite articles"".)",Indefinite Article,http://linguistics-ontology.org/gold/2010/IndefiniteArticle,,indefinite article,http://www.isocat.org/rest/dc/1308,

35,independent personal pronoun,An independent personal pronoun is a personal pronoun that is a free form.,"Siewierska (2004: 16): ""The basic division of person markers in regard to morphophonological form is that between independent and dependent person markers. Other terms used for the independent forms are free, full, self/standing, cardinal, focal, strong, long and disjunctive. ... Typically what is meant by an independent/free/full, etc. person form is a person marker which constitutes a separate word and may take primary word stress, such as the English I, me, you, she, they.","An alternative term that is often used is ""free personal pronoun"". Since personal pronouns in English, German and Russian are always free, the modifier ""independent"" is very often omitted. The definition here is not in terms of ""separate word"" (as in Siewierska 2004: 16), but in terms of ""free form"".",Personal Pronoun,http://linguistics-ontology.org/gold/2010/PersonalPronoun,"GOLD does not distinguish between independent personal pronouns and bound person forms.

46,accusative flag,An accusative flag is a flag that marks a nominal as P-argument (in a transitive clause).,,"(1) This function need not be the only function; such flags commonly also express temporal extension (e.g. German eine-n Tag [one-ACC day] ‘for one day’), or the R-argument in a ditransitive clause.

(2) In many languages, only some of the P-arguments are marked by an accusative flag, in particular those with relatively high prominence (“differential object marking”).",Accusative Case,http://linguistics-ontology.org/gold/2010/AccusativeCase,"GOLD only takes accusative ""case"" into account, neglecting accusative ""adpositions"".",accusative case,http://www.isocat.org/rest/dc/1226,
47,flag,A flag is a marker that occurs on a nominal and gives information about its semantic role or syntactic role.,,"The term ""flag"" is a recent innovation in typology to refer to case forms and adpositions jointly.

102,syntactic role,,,,,,,,,
104,interrogative pronoun,An interrogative pronoun is a form that occurs in a content question and that occupies the position of the open parameter at issue.,,"(LINGTYP Oct 2017)

This definition would comprise forms such as Italian ""cosa"" (which means 'what?' or 'thing'), as well as French ""que"" (which is a bound form, in that it cannot occur by itself). Perhaps these are not ""genuine"" interrogative pronouns, in the sense that they are free forms (like Latin ""quid?""), or in the sense that they only occur in an interrogative context (again like Latin ""quid?""). But since even the forms of well-known languages may occur in non-interrogative contexts (e.g. most English wh-pronouns, used in relative clauses), it does not seem reasonable to define ""interrogative pronoun"" in a narrow sense.

I do share the feeling that Abkhaz and Abaza are unusual in some way, but I'm not sure how best to express this with clear comparative concepts. These elements may have been described as part of ""verbal morphology"", but this is more a claim about the orthography than about any clear property of the language.",,,,,,
105,person,"Person is a dimension of grammatical meaning which has three values, two of which are speech roles: the speaker (1st person) and the hearer (2nd person), plus other referents that are neither speaker nor hearer (and do not include them) (3rd person).",,,,,,,,
